gEDA schematic and PCB 
======================

The gEDA project has produced and continues working on a full GPL'd suite and
toolkit of Electronic Design Automation tools.

Comparing with other big shot in open source EDA tool KiCAD this is far far far
more easy to use and develop atleast on the PCB front.

Fully recommend to use this tool for novice users.
